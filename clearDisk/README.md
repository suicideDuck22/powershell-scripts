This script has been created for clear machines on the corporative environment, turning this process more easy. He makes things like clear Google Chrome cache, Microsoft Teams Cache, Temp folders and local users that not make login at a certain time.

This is why is needed inform the user using the machine at the time of the executation of this script, because the environment variables can be changed on executing with an administrator user.

Have some issues that can be changed, and more features can be implemented.

This script is growing slowly...
